/**
 * Central white-label brand configuration.
 *
 * Every client-visible brand string/asset must come from here instead of
 * hardcoding the upstream "Dograh" branding. All values are driven by
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_* env vars (inlined at build time), so the deployment owner
 * can rebrand without code changes:
 *
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_NAME         - product name shown to clients (default: "VoiceAI Platform")
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_LOGO         - optional logo image URL/path (e.g. /brand-logo.png)
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_TAGLINE      - optional product tagline/description
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_DOCS_URL     - optional docs site base URL. Unset -> "Learn more"
 *                                    links fall back to the upstream public docs.
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_PRIVACY_URL  - optional privacy policy URL. Unset -> link hidden.
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_TERMS_URL    - optional terms of service URL. Unset -> link hidden.
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_COMMUNITY    - "true" to show upstream community links
 *                                    (GitHub star badge, Slack invite). Default hidden.
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_MODE        - "true" to force the client-safe UI (hide model/provider/
 *                                    API-key/engine settings) for everyone except superusers
 *                                    (UserModel.is_superuser — see useIsAdmin).
 *
 * NOTE: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_* must be referenced statically (property
 * access on process.env) for Next.js to inline them — do not loop/index.
